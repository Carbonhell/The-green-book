# Introduction
Welcome to the green book! The point of this book is to provide insight to BYOND players looking towards contributing on the game they play on, or who decide to start their own BYOND project. The objective of this guide is to teach coders the Dream Maker programming language and its lesser-known details. If you find an error or you want to contribute, you can go check our [GitHub]. You can also join the coderbus [discord] if you need help with code or this guide itself
