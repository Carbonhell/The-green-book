# Basic Concepts
This chapter covers concepts that are shares by nearly all programming languages, such as conditional statements, loops, variables, operators and the such. If DM is your first programming language, you have to read this. If not, quickly skimming over it may be useful to see DM's syntax for basic concepts.

Keywords used for the concept above and others cannot be used as names of variables, functions or such, or a conflict would happen. If you try to, a compiler error will warn you.
